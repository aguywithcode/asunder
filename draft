"I was attacked by goblins outside the village. They have a raiding party and are headed this way"

Well there goes the plans for a peaceful night of rest and a good meal. The rider finishes her ale in a big gulp and unsheathes her sword.

"Well, I guess I was looking for an adventure", she says wiping the foam from her face.

Throwing off her cloak, she reveals to gasps in the crowd her true appearance. The unmistakable pointed ears, high cheekbones, dark brown skin, and stunning beauty of an Elf.

"What's an elf doing in this part of the world?"

"Perhaps she brought the goblins with her."

She's used to it, that's why she normally keeps her hood drawn and travels at night. People always make assumptions about Elvenkind. If only those fools knew the sacrifices she's made so they can sleep soundly at night and hold their prejudices.

As she grits her teeth at the insults being flung, she hesitates for a moment...and the thought flashes through her head that she should just leave these wretches to their fate. But she shakes it off. No one deserves to die at the hands of goblins. Not even these fools.

As she steps toward the door among the jeers...

"Yeah run coward..."
"Take your damned curse with you..."

She hears a more sullen voice.

"Surely you're not going to face them alone"

"Why do you care" she begins as she turns to face the interloper.

And before her stands a vizerei. One of the few practitioners of magic. Wearing a flowing, silk, midnight blue robe ornamented with golden symbols. Open across his bare chest and tied at his waist over white linen pants.

The rider looks up from his toned torso to see a concerned face behind a grizzled beard and piercing hazel eyes.

"Because I didn't want you to go off and have all the fun," he says with a smirk.

"I guess I could leave a few alive for you, but try to keep up"

She opens the door and steps out to see her trusted steed, Willow.

Patting Willow's head she reaches into her saddlebags for a quiver and grabs her ironwood longbow from across the saddle.

She sees a streak of lightning in the distance and hears the thunder rolling in shortly thereafter. She turns to look at the inn and sees the lights extinguished and hears the bar coming down across the door with a loud thud.

"Well my friend in combat," she says as she preps for the oncoming onslaught of both steel and rain.
"It looks like it's just you, Willow, and I that stands between these cowards and certain doom."

"Indeed," the vizerei says with a grim nod. "Since we will be depending on each other for life and limb, a proper introduction might be in order. My name is Aesir," he says holding out his hand "Aesir of House Donatoth."

"A pleasure Aesir," as she grasps his hand in both of hers (an Elven custom similar to a human hug). "I am Sariel Liandon."

As the raindrops begin to fall on her leather armor, she hears a twig snap in the distance.

"Sounds like the advance scout has arrived," she comments nonchalantly as she fletches a bow and releases it in a smooth motion.

As the goblin was looking to see what looked like two humans to him were doing, he heard the distinct thrum of Sariel's longbow. The last thought he had as the arrow entered his eye (and a split second later his brain cutting off that thought) was how did she see him from that far.

Sariel hears the goblin collapse as her arrow hits home and sees specks of light deeper in the forest.

"Dirty bastards aren't even trying to hide their approach," she grumbles. "Makes for easy pickings."

As the casual raindrops turn into a full downpour, she sees them approaching the clearing. A full troop of twenty goblins, five of them riding atop the backs of worgs, nasty wolf-like creatures only twice the size...and double the teeth.

The worg-riders see Sariel and Aesir standing alone (beside Willow) and begin charging. She lets fly three arrows in steady succession and three worgs crash into the mud face first, throwing their riders into the air due to the abrupt stops.

Beside her Aesir closes his eyes, places his hands together and begins mumbling.

"Now is not the time for prayer..." Sariel begins to yell over the thunder.

Before she can finish the Vizerei's eyes open with a golden glow as the symbols on his robe begin to glow as well. He quickly motions his hands to his side as if he were throwing a ball forward and yells out "Inflagram"

Suddenly the three unsaddled worg riders burst into brilliant flames. The two trailers who are still seated pull up short. Making them prime targets for two more of Sariel's arrows...thrum thrum...goes her bow string. And two satisfying thuds follow.

Riderless, the worgs charge at Sariel and Aesir. She unsheathes her sword and readies her posture to take on one of them.

Aesir claps his hand together and a loud boom comes from them as Sariel sees the other worg disintegrate from the corner of her eye. The second worg is bounding toward her teeth snarling. He lunges at her ready to grasp her throat in his gaping maw...

As a child, Sariel's studies consisted of what an average human (well one of noble birth) would study: history, math, science, alchemy, philosophy, language and even some basic magic. The real fun for her came after she put the books away and studies became more "practical."

Some of her classmates who showed more promise with magic would go off with the local vizerei to train in the mystical arts. The stories they would tell in the bunk rooms late at night. The proudest moment of a young vizerei pupil was when they were given their first robe...always white because they had yet to choose a "domus arcanus" (arcane house). Or rather the house had yet to choose them. As they grew in skills, an obvious proficiency would show for a specific domus:

Domus Naturae - the house of nature was for the vizerei who controls the elements with their magic. Fire, water, wind, and earth in all their various forms were at these spell casters command. Their robes were a deep shade of blue that almost looked black. Like the night sky.

Domus praesidium - the house of protection focused on spells of defense. Their magic at the highest levels could protect the wielder and his friends from the flames of a dragon's breath. Their robes are a rich shade of red symbolizing the personal sacrifice required to use them.

Domus umbrae - the house of shadows were home to those who wield control over dark forces. They could make an enemy's worst nightmare appear before them. Or cast a dark magical shadow that even the sun couldn't penetrate. Sariel also heard rumors that they could reanimate the dead and even summon demons. Their robes were colored a brilliant yellow representing the sun because without light there could be no shadow.

There were other lesser houses but these were the three most commonly discussed among the vizerei pupils.

Sariel had a different calling. She trained to be astyanax: protector of the city. Her training included multiple forms of ranged and melee combat. Against single and multiple opponents. The astyanax made their own weapons so that they were intimately familiar with them.

Sariel studied under a blacksmith for two decades before she made her sword. She spent five years learning the intricacies of bow making from selecting the wood to choosing the perfect feathers to control her arrows so they would aim true. She spent ten years training to fire the bow blindfolded so that she could hit a target based on sound alone.

Sariel's final challenge as a sword master was the gauntlet. A room with a tightrope that she had to cross as heavy bags of sand were swung across her path. Her job was not to avoid those bags but to slice them open so they could not harm her.

Sariel danced through the swinging bags, her sword slicing through the leather and spilling sand as each bag empties out its contents harmlessly behind her. As she nears the end of the gauntlet an instructor launches a bag so that it swings not across the path but directly at her.

There is no side stepping this one. her reflexes take over, she leans back grabbing the rope behind her and slices her sword through the air...

And it makes contact with the worg's chest as it flies over her, slicing it from sternum to tail spilling its innards as it howls in agony before landing and collapsing behind her.

Aesir looks at her astounded as the glow in his eyes fade away. "I'd heard tales of Elven battle training but--"

"Chat later," she interject. "Now we have to deal with 15 goblins who obviously didn't get the message. Hope you've got some more of that magic left in you," as her bow thrums three more arrows that find a new home the hearts of three unwitting goblins.

"Well that's not how it works...but I do have a few tricks up my sleeve," Aesir responds with another mischievous grin as he stretches his arms out and begins to rise. The golden symbols on his robe start glowing so brightly she can't bear to look.

Of course she already know that's not how it works. The vizerei pupils explained to her that the arcane forces exist in the world and using the power makes the vizerei more like a conduit than a source of magic.

"It's like a painter, dipping his brush into the paint and applying it to a canvas to make a masterpiece," Taunathuel explained to her one night.

"So the magic is the paint and you're the painter?" she ask.

"And the brush...and the masterpiece is a battlefield of slain foes."

"Calamdas," Aesir's voice booms like the Thunder itself, bringing her out of her memory, and he streaks toward the ground like a bolt of lighting totally obliterating half of the goblin troop. The remaining six charge toward her across the town square.

She lowers her bow and unsheathes her sword again. And meets their charge head on.

The first goblin comes at her with sword overhead and she deftly sidestep it's aggressive slash as her blade slices his exposed belly open. The next has a pointed shield and slashes for her ankle. You plant her right foot and roll to the left diving over the sword and coming up on his now exposed right shoulder blade which makes a perfect target for her blade to slide into and puncture vital organs. You're staring down the third before this one has a chance to choke on the blood rushing into his lungs.

He attacks with two swords as his friend flanks her. She easily deflects his two slashes as the one behind her, thinking she's unaware rushes at her back. With a swift spin she dodges out of the way sending the rusher head first into his cohort. Well headfirst if you ignore the fact that his head was already rolling on the ground from the backhand slash she gave him as she spinned out of his way.

The other goblin falls easy prey to her sword being buried under his headless friend.

As she stabs down she sees the final two approaching cautiously to either side of her.

Well if they are just gonna stand there, I guess I have to make the first move, she thinks to herself.

Pulling her sword from the freshly made carcass, she pokes at their defenses with a few casual thrusts which they parry.

Finally a challenge, she thinks as the goblins launch their attacks in unison. She deflects the first two swipes easily, dancing backwards in time to avoid their second swings.

Having seen her take down their friends, neither goblin is attempting an aggressive attack. Perhaps she can trick them into taking an opening that doesn't exist. She slashes at the goblin to the right which he parries as expected. She over exaggerates the effect of the parry, exposing her back to the second goblin. As he attempts to capitalize on her apparent stumble, she rolls backwards switching positions with him, exposing his back to her which she quickly stabs through with her sword.

Leaving just Sariel and one last foe. Who sudden turns into a block of ice shaped like a goblin.

"I had him," she growls at Aesir realizing what happened.

"I know you did, but I want this one alive," Aesir explains. "Don't you find it strange that they didn't run away. They fought to the last goblin."

"So?"

"So when have you known goblins to be such determined warriors?"

"You're right," dammit she thinks to herself. Whatever the hell is behind this, is scarier to the goblins than death.
