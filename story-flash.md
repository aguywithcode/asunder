# Story Flash for Asunder
## 0. Theme

Bigotry keeps us divided and weakens us all

## 1. Primary Situation

An ancient demon, thought to be defeated millenia ago, has returned and is hell-bent on avenging his defeat. He has had 10000 years to plot his revenge, and most of the world has moved on, believing him to be an ancient myth.

## 2. Protagonist

Sariel Liandon is an outcast, two times over. Born to tow worlds, accepted by neither. She finds herself pulled into this battle to save them all. She wants to discover who or what is behind the increase in activity from the underworld and put an end to it.

## 3. Protagonist Skills

Sariel is a highly skilled archer and swordswoman. She knows a light amount of magic (simple spells and magic theory). She is an accomplished huntress and highly intelligent. Beyond her trained skills, she has keen instincts and intuition that gives her the ability to perform above her conscious abilities.


## 4. Protagonist Tools

Sariel has three weapons given to her as a birthright by her father (A high ranking noble in Elvish society):

* A quiver that magically never runs out of arrows.

* A magical sword with unknown properties but is definitely unbreakable by most materials.

* And a dagger that when thrown can be recalled to her hand.

She also has a bow that she crafted herself from the branch of a heartwood tree.

## 5. Emotional Wound

Sariel feels rejected by both cultures she was born into. Her mother was Ngiri, a nomadic desert tribe of humans. Her father was a high ranking elvish noble. Elves look down their noses at humans and have nothing but contempt for Ngiri whom they call barbarians. In reality, the Ngiri are a sophisticated culture. They practice a form of magic that is in tune with nature. their warriors practice totemic shamanism, taking on aspects of their spirit animals and even some have reported seeing them transform into animals.

## 6. Protagonist Flaw

Sariel finds it difficult to trust people. And to deal with the threat she's facing, she will have to give that up.

## 7. Antagonist

The ancient demon of legend who was "defeated" millennia ago. He seeks vengeance against those who vanquished him.
